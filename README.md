# jQuery-weather-app

This is a weather app using jQuery, HTML, and CSS along with the OpenWeather API to get weather reports by zip code. 
Add your zip code at the top and weather results will display underneath. 
If the main temperature is below 40 degrees, the temperature output will be blue, and if it is above 90 degrees, it will be red. 
The default color is black.
